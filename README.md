# Bird-Flight
A 2D game where the goal is to jump from platform to platform to go as high as possible

There are 4 branches:
1. main : contains this document outlining the branches
2. mainBranch: contains general scripts about the player movement, singleton, etc.
3. UI : contains everything related to UI management. 
4. Platform: contains scripts for different platform behaviors & a very beginner friendly level generator


What can be improved:
1. I'm working on applying the object pooling pattern to replace the instantiate generator
2. Enemies: Putting some dynamic enemies to make it more and more challenging as the score increases.
3. Obstacles: Static obstacles to make it a tiny bit harder
4. Slightly (tiny tiny bit) increase the player speed
